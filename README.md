# Terminal Tools Server Sync Core

This module won't do much on it's own, but needs and additional framework 
specific module.

At the moment we're working on modules for Wordpress and SilverStripe.



## Installation

Add the following to your `ttools-config.yml` (setting the framework module you're using):

	ServerSync:
		FrameworkModule: 'ttools-wordpress-sync'
